<p>When you think of social media, what comes to mind? Images, photographs, and video clips. When it comes to keeping your followers updated on your brand or service, images and videos are the most common ways of doing so. </p>



<p><strong>But have you ever thought about incorporating motion graphics into your social media?</strong> If not, let us give you some insight into why they’re important and why you need them in your brand’s strategy. </p>



<p>This article will explain exactly what motion graphics are and why they’re beneficial for your social media presence. Read on to learn more about this amazing type of graphic design and how it can take your branding up a notch.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The world is Social Media, we&#8217;re just living in it</h2>



<p>Social media is an essential platform for your brand to connect with your audience. Social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok have millions of active users, making it an ideal platform for businesses to promote their brand and reach a wider audience. </p>



<p>With so much competition on social media, it&#8217;s essential to create engaging (and consistent) content that captures your audience&#8217;s attention. One effective way to do this is by using <a href="https://sevahcreative.com/content/">motion graphics.</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">First up, what are Motion Graphics?</h2>



<p>There’s no doubt about it: visual content is important for brands on social media and beyond. However, the term “visual content” can be very broad. Graphics are all around us – including in the form of text. When we say that brands should focus on visual content, we’re talking about imagery, photographs, videos, and, yes, even motion graphics. </p>



<p><strong>Motion graphics are a type of animation that combines graphic design and animation to create an engaging and visually appealing video. </strong>They can be used to convey complex information in a simple and visually appealing way. Motion graphics are used in a variety of applications, including television commercials, explainer videos, product demonstrations, and social media posts.</p>



<p><strong>These are all a variety of motion graphics:</strong></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ok, but why are Motion Graphics important?</h2>



<p>If you’re wondering why you should incorporate motion graphics into your social media, then the first answer is: <strong>you can tell a better story. </strong></p>



<p>If you’re just sharing text or images on social media, you’re missing out on a huge opportunity. Motion allows you to talk about your brand, your products, and your service in a way that is much more memorable. Visuals and motion graphics allow you to tell a story in a way that is informative but also entertaining. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How can Motion Graphics help your Social Media presence?</h2>



<p>There are several reasons why motion graphics are engaging for social media:</p>



<p><strong>Attention-Grabbing. </strong>Motion graphics are visually appealing and can capture the viewer&#8217;s attention quickly. Social media users are scrolling through their feeds at a rapid pace, and it&#8217;s important to create content that stands out. Motion graphics are an excellent way to do this.</p>



<p><strong>Easily Digestible. </strong>Motion graphics can convey complex information in a simple and easily digestible way. Social media users don&#8217;t want to spend too much time reading through long posts. Motion graphics can provide information quickly and effectively, making them an ideal way to communicate with your audience.</p>



<p><strong>Versatile. </strong>Motion graphics can be used in a variety of ways on social media. They can be used to create promotional videos, explain how products work, showcase a brand&#8217;s values, and much more. This versatility makes motion graphics a valuable tool for businesses on social media.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3 ways Motion Graphics will help grow your brand</h2>



<p><strong>Video is King. </strong>As mentioned, video is incredibly important when it comes to social media. For example, Reels and TikTok are one of the best ways to get social traction currently, but videography can be time consuming and expensive. A motion graphic or combination of video with motion graphic can bring your brand to life in an effective way.</p>



<p><strong>Engagement is Crucial.</strong> Videos are engaging, pure and simple. Even if it&#8217;s just a combination of static images with clever motion graphic overlays, we can make it scroll-stopping. Motion graphics can be a great way to re-use your static content too.</p>



<p><strong>Storytelling is the Foundation. </strong>Telling a story is easier with movement, visual and sound. A static image or photo just doesn&#8217;t always cut it. Give your followers a visual story time with motion graphics so they can&#8217;t help but stay and watch.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tips for using Motion Graphics for Social Media</h2>



<ol>
<li><strong>Keep it Short and Sweet: </strong>Social media users have a short attention span, so it&#8217;s important to keep your motion graphics short and to the point. Try to keep your videos under 30 seconds if possible.</li>



<li><strong>Use Captions:</strong> Many social media users watch videos without sound, so it&#8217;s important to include captions. Captions will ensure that your audience can understand your message even if they&#8217;re watching your video on mute.</li>



<li><strong>Keep Branding Consistent: </strong>Make sure that your motion graphics are consistent with your brand&#8217;s overall look and feel. This will help to reinforce your brand&#8217;s identity and make your content easily recognizable.</li>



<li><strong>Use Calls-to-Action:</strong> Include a call-to-action in your motion graphics to encourage your audience to take action. This could be anything from &#8220;Follow us for more content&#8221; to &#8220;Visit our website to learn more.&#8221;</li>



<li><strong>Use High-Quality Graphics: </strong>Your motion graphics should be visually appealing and of high quality. Poor quality graphics will detract from your message and make your content less engaging.</li>



<li><strong>Test and Iterate:</strong> Experiment with different types of motion graphics and see what works best for your audience. Use analytics to track engagement and adjust your strategy accordingly.</li>

<p>Marketing jargon can confuse many people –&nbsp;including the professionals! Certain terms are often used quite loosely and end up being jumbled together, sometimes leading us to think they are one and the same. However, when it comes to the design of logos and brands – there is a clear distinction between them. </p>



<p>So we want to help you quickly understand the distinction between what a brand is, branding, a brand identity and logo design.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Is A Logo?</strong></h2>



<p>At its simplest, a logo can be defined as a visual, written text or a combination of both representing a brand, its name and what your business does. </p>



<p>Looking at what a brand is from a bigger picture, brand logo designs are a vital part of a business’s brand identity. This is because it is the one factor that identifies your brand and is recognisable to people. It is a vehicle that conveys your brand’s personality and value. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><strong>However, it is important to remember that a logo is not your brand.</strong></p></blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Is A Brand?</strong></h2>



<p>The overall image that businesses and professionals portray through a collection of perceptions, feelings, and ideas about their business to consumers, is a brand – <strong>brands are a function of branding efforts. </strong></p>



<p>But remember that <em>your brand is built over time</em> through actions and practices that eventually become a norm from the perspective of consumers.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Is Branding?</strong></h2>



<p>How is it then that a brand becomes a brand from the company’s efforts? Branding! The actions taken by businesses to build the image that consumers consume and notice is essentially what branding is. These are the processes that affect how your business or company develops its identity. </p>



<p>These can be seen in the company’s logo and in the brand mark sent out to the world, the voice of the business, its tone and how it communicates with its consumers, among other things.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Is a Brand Identity?</strong></h2>



<p>Here, your business focuses on the identity being created through the branding process. How you want to be seen and every part of the branding right through to your logo. </p>



<p>Your brand identity aims to shine a light on your company’s unique purposes. These can be seen in your logo, business material, non-visual communication, messaging, marketing material, product packaging, and signage. Generally this is brought together in a Brand Guide or similar brand identity documentation –&nbsp;that can be used for internal stakeholders (and limited external stakeholders). The main goal of a Brand Guide is to help everyone involved in the business, to continue to grow that brand over time.</p>



<p>It is important that you clearly define and understand the roles and purposes of each of the above mentioned. This will help you set clear goals and objectives for your business so that execution is seamless. Furthermore, this will help support your business activities and enable the brand logo design company you work with to work effectively.</p>



<p><strong>At Sevah Creative, we’re ready to take your business design, from logos to brand identity, to the next level.</strong> We are professionals at producing top-notch brand logo designs services and are ready to help you. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://sevahcreative.com/design/">Brand logo design services </a>or a &#8220;brand identity&#8221; is a way to make a memorable impression and allow your audience to connect with your product or service.</h3>



<p>So you’re starting a business, or perhaps you’ve got a couple of years under your belt. Everything seems to be moving smoothly, but somehow there’s a gap; you’re not getting the conversion you’re working so hard for. The problem? Your branding might be missing the mark.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/EhvVoeXC1PIIM/giphy.gif" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p>There&#8217;s many elements to a brand identity and <em>really good</em> branding can help distinguish your business from your competitors, clarify your offerings and set you apart. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>Branding can make or break your business.</p></blockquote>



<p><strong>But it’s not just about the logo design.</strong> There is much more included and involved in creating a solid brand identity –&nbsp;it&#8217;s everything from the logo to the colour palette, font choices, illustrative style, photography aesthetic – even the tone of voice, company vision and mission is part of your brand. </p>



<p>Before diving into a new brand identity, it’s important to remember the design details, such as the brand colour palette, fonts, and all the design do’s and don’ts.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What’s Included In A Brand Logo Design?</strong></h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Memorable Encounters</h3>



<p>What comes first &#8211; the brand or the logo? Is there a difference?</p>



<p>Yes, there is definitely a difference! The thing with the first question is that much like everything in digital marketing; things are constantly being redefined and adjusted. With this being said, your brand should be in the frontline, followed by a logo that matches and enhances this brand identity. Neither should be created in a silo, but as a part of an overall strategy.</p>



<p>The logo is often what pieces the puzzle together. Logos have a way of sparking nostalgia, shared experiences, and tap into our emotions.</p>



<p>In fact, often when we do logo design, we create sub marks for different application e.g. your primary logo may be quite complicated, so a simpler version is necessary for small spaces. </p>



<p>But, as I mentioned, branding services aren’t all about the logo, there’s more.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://sevahcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/How-to-Empower-Yourself-with-Color-Psychology-Varying-Colors.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-36180" width="796" height="430" srcset="https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/How-to-Empower-Yourself-with-Color-Psychology-Varying-Colors.jpg?size=216x117&amp;lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 216w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/How-to-Empower-Yourself-with-Color-Psychology-Varying-Colors-480x259.jpg?lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 480w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/How-to-Empower-Yourself-with-Color-Psychology-Varying-Colors.jpg?size=648x350&amp;lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 648w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/How-to-Empower-Yourself-with-Color-Psychology-Varying-Colors.jpg?lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 796w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 796px, 100vw" /><figcaption>via <a href="https://londonimageinstitute.com/how-to-empower-yourself-with-color-psychology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">London Image Institute</a></figcaption></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Appealing Colour Palette</h3>



<p>Closely following the logo design is the colour palette, which can be any number of colours and sub-palettes. Understanding how colours trigger emotions and interact with each other is essential for representing your brand strategy in the right way.</p>



<p>Colour is very subjective of course – with personal, situational and even cultural factors coming into play.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.printed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-20-at-11.57.04.png" alt="Understanding the psychology of typography is a powerful tool in any graphic designer’s arsenal. If you’re a designer or creative then you’ve probably spent hours sifting through different typography styles, in order to find that perfect one for a customer or client. But how do you know which font to pick when designing for a brand, business, piece of promotional material or, well, just about anything? A simple font change can drastically affect a piece of artwork or document, but what is it about typography that can change a perception so quickly? We’re going to take a look at the psychology of typography, its importance, and how knowing your stuff can make all the difference when it comes to design – so settle in, grab a cuppa, and get ready to take a wordy-journey through serifs, letterpress, branding and perception."/><figcaption>via <a href="https://www.printed.com/blog/psychology-of-typography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Printed</a></figcaption></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Maximise On The Typography</h3>



<p>The font you use is not something to take lightly. The type of font you receive from brand logo design services needs to complement both the logo and colours for perfect harmony.</p>



<p>Remember, there is power in the fonts you choose. In many cases, your brand logo font is instantly recognisable, even in a different context, and that’s the power of typography.</p>



<p>Your logo font is often different from fonts you use for everyday applications –&nbsp;and you will likely need different fonts for web, print and email –&nbsp;there&#8217;s more to it than just aesthetics!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">On-brand Supporting Graphics &amp; Photography</h3>



<p>The world has never been brighter or so multidimensional. Graphics, <a href="https://sevahcreative.com/work/product-photography/">product photography</a> and illustrative elements are a strong part of your brand identity –&nbsp;design assets, icons, photography and more goes a long way to expanding on a visual message. </p>



<p>It’s clear that there’s a lot that goes into brand logo design services that needs an expert’s touch, a keen eye and insights in design. For this reason, you need to make sure that you have the best team on your side. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The short story:</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><strong>We&#8217;ve rebranded our <a href="https://sevahcreative.com/">creative agency</a> from Lifestyle Collective.co to Sevah Creative®. </strong></p></blockquote>



<p>We wouldn&#8217;t have made it this far without your support and business, so a big thank you to all our wonderful clients –&nbsp;we truly appreciate the projects we get to create and the long-term partnerships that with have with many of you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The slightly longer story:</h2>



<p>The Lifestyle Collective.co name was originally an umbrella brand encompassing both our creative work and our health business (headed up by my partner John). After we sold the health business in December 2019, neither the brand or name was the right fit anymore.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve spent 2020 working with our amazing clients to create awesome projects across a variety of industries; but we&#8217;ve also been very busy behind the scenes:</p>



<ul><li>We partnered with a team of developers, copywriters and SEO/PPC experts at the start of 2020 –&nbsp;which means we can focus on what we do best and leave these areas to the more skilled practitioners.</li><li>John has officially joined the team, heading up our product videography and motion graphics work. He has spent most of 2020 learning – completing his&nbsp;drone RPL (Remote Pilot License) as well as a course in professional colour grading and refining his skills in Adobe Premiere and Adobe After Effects.</li><li>I (Zoe) started offering product photography about halfway through the year – a natural progression from her many years of food photography, she has spent almost 2 years translating this experience into product based work. This is an area we&#8217;ll be expanding further in 2021.</li></ul>



<p>We believe strongly in always learning new skills and refining what we&#8217;re good at. This allows us to bring an even higher quality standard of work to everything we do; as well as the new offerings that we&#8217;re pretty excited about.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Our services</h2>



<p>All of these means that we&#8217;ve had the time to sit down and finesse our services. </p>

<p>The age old saying that “you get what you pay for” couldn’t ring truer when it comes to logo design. Whilst it’s tempting to try to save dollars in the early days of your business, your <a href="https://sevahcreative.com/design/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">logo design</a> and branding shouldn’t be where you scrimp.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>Whilst crowd-sourcing in general is a super cool concept, #sorrynotsorry, but we just can’t get behind a crowd-sourced logo design.</p></blockquote>



<p>Imagine if you had to wear just one t-shirt for the rest of your life. You wouldn’t be trying on the cheapest tee on the rack, that’s not quite your size and that you’re pretty sure you saw three people wearing very similar ones last week.</p>



<p>You’d be looking for the highest quality t-shirt. One that’s classic in style, tailored to your body and is going to represent your personality best for years to come. And you wouldn’t be concerned about what it cost because you know it’s an investment – you’re going to wear it for the rest of your life after all!</p>



<p>Luckily, you don’t have to pull a Mark Zuckerberg and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/mark-zuckerberg-favorite-tshirt-2017-7">wear the same t-shirt everyday</a>.</p>



<p>But your business does have to wear the same logo every day, so it’s vital that you don’t make the mistake of going the budget route.</p>



<p>Here’s five reasons why you should avoid cheap or crowd-sourced logo design at all costs –</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Plagiarism is rife</h2>



<p>A crowd-sourced logo design seems like a great option – you get to choose from a lot of designs from multiple designers and only pay for the final one you want.</p>



<p>Anybody can enter a crowd-sourcing competition. No experience necessary, no portfolio. Your new “designer” likely doesn’t have any actual design skills, but they will often rip-off other’s designs or create logos by lightly editing stock graphics or vectors.</p>



<p>You’re very likely to end up with an un-original logo design (than any real designer will be able to spot as a stock template a mile away). Even worse, you could be in an expensive infringement lawsuit if your new logo has been stolen from someone else.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Here today, gone tomorrow?</h2>



<p>Your new logo will be EVERYWHERE. Across your website, your business cards, your email signature, your flyers, white papers, social media accounts, email templates etc.</p>



<p>A logo created from a stock graphic/template might look very ‘on-trend’ this month, but it will quickly become outdated and make your brand look tired.&lt;</p>



<p>When you finally realise how much you hate your logo 6-12 months later and decide to invest in a better one; you’ll end up paying more and spending more time to get everything up to date. Not to mention the lack of brand continuity for your customers.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Too much choice is tiresome</h2>



<p>25, 50 or even hundreds of crowd-sourced designs for free – sounds awesome right?!</p>



<p>Wrong. In fact, a&nbsp;study from&nbsp;<a href="http://web-docs.stern.nyu.edu/pa/sellier_dahl_creative_success.pdf">New York University</a>&nbsp;showed that “restricting the choice of creative inputs actually enhances creativity.”</p>



<p>The problem is that trying to decide between too many choices is exhausting and we make bad decisions when we are tired. It’s caused by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.swarthmore.edu/SocSci/bschwar1/SchwartzCulture.pdf">decision fatigue</a>. Your brain can only filter and sort through so many things at once, so even if there is a decent logo within those many designs, you’ll probably miss it anyway.</p>



<p>When you work with a designer one-on-one, whilst they might go through many concepts and sketches; you will likely only see the best 3-5 concepts. This process makes it much easier for you choose effectively, saving you time and make the process far more pleasant.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. The Package Deal Trap</h2>



<p>That $49 offer may sound like a great deal; but being confined to “2 concepts and 1 revision” means there is almost no flexibility or room for error in the design process.</p>



<p>It definitely won’t involve much of your valuable feedback or input.</p>



<p>This cookie-cutter approach almost guarantees you’re getting a logo from a stock website.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Organic collaboration</h2>



<p>Whilst you’re hiring a designer to use their knowledge and skills to create an amazing design; you know your brand the best and therefore your input is essential throughout the design process.</p>



<p>The best logo design comes from an an organic relationship with clear communication between you and your designer.</p>



<p>A great designer will be an asset to your brand ongoing, so choosing quality from the start means you have someone that knows your branding inside out for future design work.</p>



<p>Being familiar with a brand’s guideline and aesthetic makes the briefing process simpler and the design process often faster, saving you money down the track.</p>



<p><strong>In other words, don’t by the oddly fitting t-shirt off the rack.</strong></p>

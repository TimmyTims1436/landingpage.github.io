<p><strong>Sure, video is king, but have you tried <a href="https://sevahcreative.com/content/">motion graphics for social media</a>? </strong></p>



<p>When you think of social media, what comes to mind? Images, photographs, and video clips. When it comes to keeping your followers updated on your brand or service, images and videos are the most common ways of doing so. </p>



<p><strong>But have you ever thought about incorporating motion graphics into your social media?</strong> If not, let us give you some insight into why they’re important and why you need them in your brand’s strategy. </p>



<p>This article will explain exactly what motion graphics are and why they’re beneficial for your social media presence. Read on to learn more about this amazing type of graphic design and how it can take your branding up a notch.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The world is Social Media, we&#8217;re just living in it</h2>



<p>Social media is an essential platform for your brand to connect with your audience. Social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok have millions of active users, making it an ideal platform for businesses to promote their brand and reach a wider audience. </p>



<p>With so much competition on social media, it&#8217;s essential to create engaging (and consistent) content that captures your audience&#8217;s attention. One effective way to do this is by using <a href="https://sevahcreative.com/content/">motion graphics.</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">First up, what are Motion Graphics?</h2>



<p>There’s no doubt about it: visual content is important for brands on social media and beyond. However, the term “visual content” can be very broad. Graphics are all around us – including in the form of text. When we say that brands should focus on visual content, we’re talking about imagery, photographs, videos, and, yes, even motion graphics. </p>



<p><strong>Motion graphics are a type of animation that combines graphic design and animation to create an engaging and visually appealing video. </strong>They can be used to convey complex information in a simple and visually appealing way. Motion graphics are used in a variety of applications, including television commercials, explainer videos, product demonstrations, and social media posts.</p>



<p><strong>These are all a variety of motion graphics:</strong></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ok, but why are Motion Graphics important?</h2>



<p>If you’re wondering why you should incorporate motion graphics into your social media, then the first answer is: <strong>you can tell a better story. </strong></p>



<p>If you’re just sharing text or images on social media, you’re missing out on a huge opportunity. Motion allows you to talk about your brand, your products, and your service in a way that is much more memorable. Visuals and motion graphics allow you to tell a story in a way that is informative but also entertaining. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How can Motion Graphics help your Social Media presence?</h2>



<p>There are several reasons why motion graphics are engaging for social media:</p>



<p><strong>Attention-Grabbing. </strong>Motion graphics are visually appealing and can capture the viewer&#8217;s attention quickly. Social media users are scrolling through their feeds at a rapid pace, and it&#8217;s important to create content that stands out. Motion graphics are an excellent way to do this.</p>



<p><strong>Easily Digestible. </strong>Motion graphics can convey complex information in a simple and easily digestible way. Social media users don&#8217;t want to spend too much time reading through long posts. Motion graphics can provide information quickly and effectively, making them an ideal way to communicate with your audience.</p>



<p><strong>Versatile. </strong>Motion graphics can be used in a variety of ways on social media. They can be used to create promotional videos, explain how products work, showcase a brand&#8217;s values, and much more. This versatility makes motion graphics a valuable tool for businesses on social media.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3 ways Motion Graphics will help grow your brand</h2>



<p><strong>Video is King. </strong>As mentioned, video is incredibly important when it comes to social media. For example, Reels and TikTok are one of the best ways to get social traction currently, but videography can be time consuming and expensive. A motion graphic or combination of video with motion graphic can bring your brand to life in an effective way.</p>



<p><strong>Engagement is Crucial.</strong> Videos are engaging, pure and simple. Even if it&#8217;s just a combination of static images with clever motion graphic overlays, we can make it scroll-stopping. Motion graphics can be a great way to re-use your static content too.</p>



<p><strong>Storytelling is the Foundation. </strong>Telling a story is easier with movement, visual and sound. A static image or photo just doesn&#8217;t always cut it. Give your followers a visual story time with motion graphics so they can&#8217;t help but stay and watch.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tips for using Motion Graphics for Social Media</h2>



<ol>
<li><strong>Keep it Short and Sweet: </strong>Social media users have a short attention span, so it&#8217;s important to keep your motion graphics short and to the point. Try to keep your videos under 30 seconds if possible.</li>



<li><strong>Use Captions:</strong> Many social media users watch videos without sound, so it&#8217;s important to include captions. Captions will ensure that your audience can understand your message even if they&#8217;re watching your video on mute.</li>



<li><strong>Keep Branding Consistent: </strong>Make sure that your motion graphics are consistent with your brand&#8217;s overall look and feel. This will help to reinforce your brand&#8217;s identity and make your content easily recognizable.</li>



<li><strong>Use Calls-to-Action:</strong> Include a call-to-action in your motion graphics to encourage your audience to take action. This could be anything from &#8220;Follow us for more content&#8221; to &#8220;Visit our website to learn more.&#8221;</li>



<li><strong>Use High-Quality Graphics: </strong>Your motion graphics should be visually appealing and of high quality. Poor quality graphics will detract from your message and make your content less engaging.</li>



<li><strong>Test and Iterate:</strong> Experiment with different types of motion graphics and see what works best for your audience. Use analytics to track engagement and adjust your strategy accordingly.</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Is A Logo?</strong></h2>



<p>At its simplest, a logo can be defined as a visual, written text or a combination of both representing a brand, its name and what your business does. </p>



<p>Looking at what a brand is from a bigger picture, brand logo designs are a vital part of a business’s brand identity. This is because it is the one factor that identifies your brand and is recognisable to people. It is a vehicle that conveys your brand’s personality and value. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><strong>However, it is important to remember that a logo is not your brand.</strong></p></blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Is A Brand?</strong></h2>



<p>The overall image that businesses and professionals portray through a collection of perceptions, feelings, and ideas about their business to consumers, is a brand – <strong>brands are a function of branding efforts. </strong></p>



<p>But remember that <em>your brand is built over time</em> through actions and practices that eventually become a norm from the perspective of consumers.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Is Branding?</strong></h2>



<p>How is it then that a brand becomes a brand from the company’s efforts? Branding! The actions taken by businesses to build the image that consumers consume and notice is essentially what branding is. These are the processes that affect how your business or company develops its identity. </p>



<p>These can be seen in the company’s logo and in the brand mark sent out to the world, the voice of the business, its tone and how it communicates with its consumers, among other things.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Is a Brand Identity?</strong></h2>



<p>Here, your business focuses on the identity being created through the branding process. How you want to be seen and every part of the branding right through to your logo. </p>



<p>Your brand identity aims to shine a light on your company’s unique purposes. These can be seen in your logo, business material, non-visual communication, messaging, marketing material, product packaging, and signage. Generally this is brought together in a Brand Guide or similar brand identity documentation –&nbsp;that can be used for internal stakeholders (and limited external stakeholders). The main goal of a Brand Guide is to help everyone involved in the business, to continue to grow that brand over time.</p>



<p>It is important that you clearly define and understand the roles and purposes of each of the above mentioned. This will help you set clear goals and objectives for your business so that execution is seamless. Furthermore, this will help support your business activities and enable the brand logo design company you work with to work effectively.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://sevahcreative.com/design/">Brand logo design services </a>or a &#8220;brand identity&#8221; is a way to make a memorable impression and allow your audience to connect with your product or service.</h3>



<p>So you’re starting a business, or perhaps you’ve got a couple of years under your belt. Everything seems to be moving smoothly, but somehow there’s a gap; you’re not getting the conversion you’re working so hard for. The problem? Your branding might be missing the mark.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/EhvVoeXC1PIIM/giphy.gif" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p>There&#8217;s many elements to a brand identity and <em>really good</em> branding can help distinguish your business from your competitors, clarify your offerings and set you apart. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>Branding can make or break your business.</p></blockquote>



<p><strong>But it’s not just about the logo design.</strong> There is much more included and involved in creating a solid brand identity –&nbsp;it&#8217;s everything from the logo to the colour palette, font choices, illustrative style, photography aesthetic – even the tone of voice, company vision and mission is part of your brand. </p>



<p>Before diving into a new brand identity, it’s important to remember the design details, such as the brand colour palette, fonts, and all the design do’s and don’ts.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What’s Included In A Brand Logo Design?</strong></h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Memorable Encounters</h3>



<p>What comes first &#8211; the brand or the logo? Is there a difference?</p>



<p>Yes, there is definitely a difference! The thing with the first question is that much like everything in digital marketing; things are constantly being redefined and adjusted. With this being said, your brand should be in the frontline, followed by a logo that matches and enhances this brand identity. Neither should be created in a silo, but as a part of an overall strategy.</p>



<p>The logo is often what pieces the puzzle together. Logos have a way of sparking nostalgia, shared experiences, and tap into our emotions.</p>



<p>In fact, often when we do logo design, we create sub marks for different application e.g. your primary logo may be quite complicated, so a simpler version is necessary for small spaces. </p>



<p>But, as I mentioned, branding services aren’t all about the logo, there’s more.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Appealing Colour Palette</h3>



<p>Closely following the logo design is the colour palette, which can be any number of colours and sub-palettes. Understanding how colours trigger emotions and interact with each other is essential for representing your brand strategy in the right way.</p>



<p>Colour is very subjective of course – with personal, situational and even cultural factors coming into play.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.printed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-20-at-11.57.04.png" alt="Understanding the psychology of typography is a powerful tool in any graphic designer’s arsenal. If you’re a designer or creative then you’ve probably spent hours sifting through different typography styles, in order to find that perfect one for a customer or client. But how do you know which font to pick when designing for a brand, business, piece of promotional material or, well, just about anything? A simple font change can drastically affect a piece of artwork or document, but what is it about typography that can change a perception so quickly? We’re going to take a look at the psychology of typography, its importance, and how knowing your stuff can make all the difference when it comes to design – so settle in, grab a cuppa, and get ready to take a wordy-journey through serifs, letterpress, branding and perception."/><figcaption>via <a href="https://www.printed.com/blog/psychology-of-typography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Printed</a></figcaption></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Maximise On The Typography</h3>



<p>The font you use is not something to take lightly. The type of font you receive from brand logo design services needs to complement both the logo and colours for perfect harmony.</p>



<p>Remember, there is power in the fonts you choose. In many cases, your brand logo font is instantly recognisable, even in a different context, and that’s the power of typography.</p>



<p>Your logo font is often different from fonts you use for everyday applications –&nbsp;and you will likely need different fonts for web, print and email –&nbsp;there&#8217;s more to it than just aesthetics!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">On-brand Supporting Graphics &amp; Photography</h3>

Graphics, <a href="https://sevahcreative.com/work/product-photography/">product photography</a> and illustrative elements are a strong part of your brand identity –&nbsp;design assets, icons, photography and more goes a long way to expanding on a visual message. </p>

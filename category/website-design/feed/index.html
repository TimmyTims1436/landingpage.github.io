<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>If you are running an eCommerce store on Shopify, it‚Äôs time to update to Shopify 2.0 as soon as possible. </strong></h4>



<p>The new Shopify 2.0 is packed with a range of useful features that can help your business grow ‚Äì but only if you have updated by now. </p>



<p>However, updating your Shopify store may seem like daunting task for some store owners. </p>



<p>We get it. Not everyone is tech-savvy, or has a in-house developer ‚Äì it can feel just a little overwhelming try to manage it all yourself! </p>



<p><strong>The good news is we can help you update your Shopify store to version 2.0 ‚Äì whether it&#8217;s upgrading your existing Theme to 2.0 OR starting with a fresh new 2.0 Theme. </strong></p>



<p>Either way, moving forward, your store will look better, load faster and be easier to update and manage!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Have you ever looked at your Shopify store and thought, <em>‚ÄúThis definitely could be better.‚Äù</em> </h2>



<p>We&#8217;d probably agree you üòâ</p>



<p><strong>The design of your store is a big part of how customers perceive your brand. </strong>High-quality, eye-catching websites are one of the first things potential customers see when they start to research various brands and products. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>In fact, a recent survey showed that 94% of website visitors say that a company‚Äôs website is important in influencing their buying decision. </em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>A strong first impression can make all the difference between someone simply reading about your brand or them immediately adding it to their shopping cart so they can add more of your merchandise to their cart later. </p>



<p>So what does that mean for you? <strong>Well, updating your store to Shopify 2.0 might be just what you need to take it from good to great!</strong> Let‚Äôs take a closer look at why‚Ä¶</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So what‚Äôs NEW in Shopify 2.0?</h2>



<p><strong>There‚Äôs a lot of new features and functionality! </strong></p>



<p>Keep in mind that these changes aren‚Äôt just cosmetic. They are designed to improve the overall online shopping experience for customers and give you more tools to help you attract new clients and increase your sales. Here‚Äôs a quick look at what you can expect from the new Shopify 2.0 design: </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Customisable home page</strong> ‚Äì add, rearrange, or remove sections to create your page layout.</li>



<li><strong><strong>Customisable Sections on ALL page</strong>s </strong>‚Äì (technically on &#8220;most&#8221; pages) ‚Äì&nbsp;you can now add, rearrange, or remove sections and blocks to create unique page layouts.</li>



<li><strong>Enhanced search engine optimisation</strong> ‚Äì every aspect of Shopify has been optimized for search engine ranking, making it easier for potential customers to find your products. </li>



<li><strong>Enhanced marketing tools for shops</strong> ‚Äì Shopify has added a few new features that let you easily promote your products across social media and your website, increasing your chances of more sales.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Sections are everywhere (YAY!)</h2>



<p>A section is what creates your page ‚Äì&nbsp;you&#8217;ll know of these if you&#8217;ve ever gone in to edit your home page. Whether it&#8217;s a banner, a featured product or collection or simply blocks of text; each of these sections in Shopify mean you can build your home page and move the Sections around without the need to code.</p>



<p>Up until the Shopify 2.0 launch, you could only use these Sections on your home page. Every other page would be a simple text post (like a blog) sitting within the same Page template ‚Äì <em>boringgggg</em>! OR you need to use a custom page builder, app or asked a developer to code it ‚Äì&nbsp;which is time consuming, requires a developer and a designer and therefore is quite costly.</p>



<p><strong>With Shopify 2.0, sections are EVERYWHERE! </strong></p>



<p>You can easily create new Page templates within the Theme Editor using the visual builder ‚Äì essentially removing the need for development time, and minimising designer time. </p>



<p>This all changes with the new Shopify 2.0 which means sections can now be used on <em>any page</em> across your entire site. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">It&#8217;s just a better customer experience</h2>



<p>Beyond just giving your store a fresh new look, Shopify 2.0 has been engineered from the ground up to create a better customer experience for your clients. </p>



<p>This includes things like enhanced search engine optimization that lets more people find your products, a new live chat feature where you can easily answer questions about your products, and an intuitive checkout process that ensures customers don‚Äôt experience any issues when completing their purchase. </p>



<p>If you‚Äôre worried that upgrading to Shopify 2.0 might cause problems for your clients, there‚Äôs no need to fret. Shopify has taken a lot of care to ensure that people who have been using Shopify 1.0 will be able to easily transition to the new platform. They‚Äôve also done their best to maintain the same level of security and privacy that existed in 1.0, so there is no reason to avoid the update.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The benefits of using Divi on a WordPress website</h2>



<p>Let&#8217;s quickly cover why we use Divi for so many of our clients&#8217; website first. Divi is a WordPress theme that offers a wide range of benefits, the main one being is its <strong>user-friendly drag-and-drop interface,</strong> which makes it easy for anyone in your marketing team to manage your content and website long-term. We prefer to empower our clients to own their website, rather than lock you into rigid maintenance agreements with us.</p>



<p><em>(But if you need, we&#8217;re here to help with managing your website once it&#8217;s built, or to help guide your team with editing content).</em></p>



<p>Divi also offers a <a href="https://www.elegantthemes.com/gallery/divi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vast library of pre-designed layouts and templates</a> that can be customised to fit your brand&#8217;s unique look and feel. This saves time and money, allowing you to focus on other important aspects of your business.</p>



<p><strong>However, we rarely work from templates as we prefer to provide a completely unique design for your brand and allows for easy management in the long-term.</strong></p>



<p>Another benefit of Divi is its responsive design, which ensures that your website looks great on all devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. Obviously important since you&#8217;re likely reading on your mobile, and Google ranks mobile-friendly websites higher in search results.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The benefits of choosing Sevah Creative to design and build your Divi website</h2>



<p>We&#8217;re small (but tenacious) team with <a href="https://sevahcreative.com/about/">Zoe</a> our founder and creative lead (an experienced designer &amp; marketing mind) and <a href="https://sevahcreative.com/about/">John</a> our co-founder (the business brain and motion graphic extraordinaire). We also have competent, skilled developer teams offshore that work with us closely to deliver a high-standard (we vet everything here); plus a wide network of social advertising experts, copywriters and content strategists, SEO experts, hosting providers and more that we love to refer our clients to. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>We may be small, but we&#8217;re smart! Our focus has always been to refer our clients to the best resources and ensure you get an excellent result ‚Äì&nbsp;rather than trying to money-grab and provide every service ourselves. </em></p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>Based on the Gold Coast Australia, we&#8217;re super passionate about creating beautiful AND functional websites.</strong> We understand the importance of a website that accurately reflects your brand&#8217;s personality and values, but also meets the specific functionality requirements of your business.</p>



<p>We include a thorough SEO migration from your existing website to your new website (so you don&#8217;t lose that precious SEO juice!) and ensure that your website is seen by the right audiences. This is especially important for Australian and Gold Coast businesses that want to attract local customers.</p>



<p>You can choose to have us involved in every aspect of your website, or just the design aspect. We work closely with you to understand your unique needs and create a bespoke website that delivers the results your business needs..</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why a custom design is vital</h2>



<p>While Divi offers a wide range of pre-designed layouts and templates, using these &#8220;cookie-cutter&#8221; templates can result in your website looking similar to many others, and not meeting the unique needs of your brand. By creating custom Divi website design (using a Child Theme), we ensure that your website accurately reflects your brand&#8217;s personality and values, and stands out from the crowd.</p>



<p>A custom Divi Child Theme offers a range of benefits, beyond just the ability to choose your own colors, fonts, and layouts. We can tailor your website specifically to your brand&#8217;s unique needs, with <a href="https://sevahcreative.com/design/">custom icon design</a> and graphics, website animation and motion graphics to bring it to life.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Sevah Creative provides a bespoke service</h2>



<p>We work closely with you to understand your unique requirements and offer a range of services to ensure that your website accurately reflects your brand&#8217;s personality.</p>



<p>Our bespoke service starts with a consultation, where we discuss your unique needs and requirements. We don&#8217;t blow out your timeline a multi stage production (unless you specifically want us to wireframe and design prior to development); instead, once copy and the site map is approved, we work directly in Divi to design and build at the same time.</p>



<p><strong>Typically we work with the homepage design first, and this helps to guide the remainder of the site design. All our projects include 1-2 rounds of revisions as agreed at the start, so we can make sure we get everything exactly right before launch.</strong></p>



<p>Whether you want us to handle everything from start to finish, or just be involved in the design aspect, we&#8217;re dedicated to creating a website that IS YOUR BRAND. You can trust that your website will not only look great, but also be functional, user-friendly, and tailored specifically to your brand&#8217;s unique needs.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re ready to take the first step in creating a custom Divi website design for your website, <a href="https://sevahcreative.com/contact/">get in touch with us today</a> (Zoe will reply back to you personally). </p>



<p>OR if you&#8217;re ready to go, just <a href="https://sevahcreative.com/website-brief/">complete our website brief form</a>, and we can get a quote back to you ASAP. </p>



<p>We&#8217;re excited to work with you every step of the way to ensure that your website is not only beautiful, but also functional.</p>

<p>A custom-built <a href="https://www.elegantthemes.com/affiliates/idevaffiliate.php?id=67803" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Divi WordPress child theme</a> is one of the best practices for your website. The great thing about using a &#8220;child theme&#8221; is that not only does it allow us to really customise your website design, build and functionality, but it also allows for ongoing updates and speeds up the development process.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re going to look at some of the benefits of having a professional, custom Divi WordPress theme developed by a web design company in Australia. We recommend and use one of the most versatile, yet easy-to-use CMS solutions for most of our website builds ‚Äì<em> WordPress with the Divi Theme and a custom Divi child theme.</em></p>



<p>But first‚Ä¶</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Is A Child Theme?</strong></h3>



<p>A child theme is essentially a sub theme that takes on the functionality, features and styling of the parent theme (in this case, the Divi theme). It provides a safe approach to modifying files, without actually editing the parent theme.</p>



<p>Child themes are made up of a series of files created via text or a code editor. WordPress will apply the parent theme files, unless there are files of the same name in the child theme ‚Äì&nbsp;in which case, the child theme will override the parent theme.</p>



<p>This allows for complete customisation of the theme, whilst maintaining the ability to easily update the themes (and not have to continually fix broken files).</p>



<p><em>To give you a simple example, a custom 404 error page is created using a child theme. When creating a custom 404 error page needs a child theme along with a 404.php file. WordPress will find a custom 404.php file in the child theme, and if no file is found to execute, it will use the default 404.php file in the Divi theme package.</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Benefits Of Custom Built Divi WordPress Child Theme</strong></h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Site Customisations</strong></h3>



<p>The above example indicates how using Divi child themes in development is a great way of making valuable enhancements to a WordPress site.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ironclad Protection</strong></h3>



<p>Divi child themes are also instrumental as they protect your website development work from future updates. Every theme will be updated at some point, and if you didn&#8217;t create a child theme, all your customisation can be overridden with the update. With a child theme in place, when the parent theme is updated, your child theme retains all the customisations.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Divi Child Themes Are Simple to Manage</strong></h3>



<p>One of the other benefits of having a web design company in Australia develop your custom Divi WordPress child theme is that once we hand you over your shiny new website, you can make basic edits yourself. You can make edits to text, images, colours, fonts etc&#8230; or duplicate elements ‚Äì via a back-end block builder OR a front-end visual builder.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.elegantthemes.com/documentation/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/visual-builder-1.jpg" alt="docs image"/><figcaption><img decoding="async" src="https://www.elegantthemes.com/documentation/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/using-visual-builder-2-2.jpg" alt="using-visual-builder-2-2"></figcaption></figure>



<p>The Divi theme is a very simple user interface that is not hard to manage with a little practice ‚Äì and if you need some help, we can package in a few hours of training for you too. </p>

<p>There are plenty of tried-and-tested methods of finding a web designer on the Gold Coast who can meet your needs. If you haven&#8217;t successfully got the right person for the job, these five key points should help.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re going to look at the characteristics you need to look out for when choosing a <a href="https://sevahcreative.com/design/">web design company</a> and web designer to help you make an informed decision.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>#1: Experience In Your Industry</strong></h2>



<p>Your starting point should always be eliminating web designers that have no experience in your field. Experience counts, but even more so if it&#8217;s in your industry. This is also important if you want to avoid tedious design processes, lengthy planning, and back and forth editing. So be sure to find a Gold Coast web designer who&#8217;s worked in your industry.</p>



<p>That said, if the website designer you‚Äôre looking at doesn‚Äôt have experience in your industry, but you really like their design aesthetic and other elements of their work ‚Äì then sometimes rules are made to be broken!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="853" src="https://sevahcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/BPD-website-1-1-1024x853.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-35269" srcset="https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/BPD-website-1-1.jpg?size=216x180&amp;lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 216w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/BPD-website-1-1-480x400.jpg?lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 480w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/BPD-website-1-1.jpg?size=648x540&amp;lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 648w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/BPD-website-1-1.jpg?size=864x720&amp;lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 864w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/BPD-website-1-1-980x817.jpg?lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 980w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" /><figcaption><a href="https://sevahcreative.com/project/bpdzenith/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://sevahcreative.com/project/bpdzenith/</a></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>#2: Appropriate Pricing</strong></h2>



<p>Next to experience, the price tag is the next vital aspect to consider. The price of hiring a web designer on the Gold Coast, Australia, will vary wildly depending on your needs and the extent of work required on your website.</p>



<p>When we say ‚Äúappropriate‚Äù ‚Äì&nbsp;we don‚Äôt just mean find the cheapest! Many of our clients come to us needing a website re-design after they went the cheap route with their initial website build. Cutting costs on your website design will very likely only create more expenses in the long-term.</p>



<p>Make sure that you set a substantial budget before going on the hunt for a web designer. Remember that web design and development‚Äôs main aim is to solve a problem. Quality web designers rely not only on their skills and expertise but on data. So, from research to factoring in your personal, unique requirements, mandatory user-experience, functionality, and robust development are essential. The age old saying that ‚Äúyou get what you pay for‚Äù definitely rings true when it comes to website design.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>#3: Knowledge, Methods &amp; Strategies</strong></h2>



<p>When narrowing down potential web designers, make sure that you find out their level of knowledge, methodology, and strategy when creating websites. Additionally, to get a grasp of their capabilities and insights that could be helpful to you, here‚Äôs some questions to consider asking:</p>



<ul><li>What is your design process? </li><li>What CMS (content management system) do they use? <em>(Is it easy to use?)</em></li><li>How will the website help to drive traffic and generate leads?</li><li>Do you follow SEO best practices when building the site?</li><li>What types of conversion strategies do you suggest?</li><li>What kind of testing do you perform prior to the launch of a new website?</li><li>Will we be able to make basic edits to the website once the site is live? <em>(This goes back the choice of CMS ‚Äì we use Divi, which is very simple to learn).</em></li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://sevahcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/StreamlineVerify-website-1-1024x853.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-35760" width="821" height="683" srcset="https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/StreamlineVerify-website-1.jpg?size=216x180&amp;lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 216w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/StreamlineVerify-website-1-480x400.jpg?lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 480w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/StreamlineVerify-website-1.jpg?size=648x539&amp;lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 648w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 821px, 100vw" /><figcaption><a href="https://sevahcreative.com/project/streamlineverify/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://sevahcreative.com/project/streamlineverify/</a></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>#4: Custom Designs</strong></h2>



<p>Make sure you ask your web designer if they are building your website design from scratch OR using a template. At Sevah, we custom design and build your website so that it‚Äôs not only 100% unique to your brand, but also so it‚Äôs actually FOR your brand ‚Äì that is, we don‚Äôt try to squish your brand and content into a stock standard template.</p>



<p>Whilst a template website may save some dollars, it won‚Äôt save you headaches down the track or give you the best conversion optimised website possible.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>#5: Long-Term Relationship</strong>s</h2>



<p>Finding the right web designer for your business can be tricky ‚Äì&nbsp;but once you‚Äôve worked with expert web designers, you&#8217;re going to want to stick with them. Make sure they are available for an ongoing relationship. It‚Äôs much easier to work long-term with one agency or designer, then having to constantly onboard new people.</p>



<p>What‚Äôs more, whenever you need additions, design changes or support a web design project, they‚Äôll easily be able to assist. After all, you‚Äôre both familiar with each other and the work they can produce!</p>



<p>Since we provide a range of <a href="/design">design</a> &amp; <a href="/content">content</a> services at <a href="https://sevahcreative.com/">Sevah Creative Agency</a>, we find many of our clients work with us long term across a variety of different areas.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">At Sevah Creative, we have an open-door policy. We believe in personalisation, transparency and providing a unique experience. We love working closely with our clients to provide them with bespoke services to meet their needs. </h3>

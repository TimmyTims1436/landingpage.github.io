<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>If you are running an eCommerce store on Shopify, it‚Äôs time to update to Shopify 2.0 as soon as possible. </strong></h4>



<p>The new Shopify 2.0 is packed with a range of useful features that can help your business grow ‚Äì but only if you have updated by now. </p>



<p>However, updating your Shopify store may seem like daunting task for some store owners. </p>



<p>We get it. Not everyone is tech-savvy, or has a in-house developer ‚Äì it can feel just a little overwhelming try to manage it all yourself! </p>



<p><strong>The good news is we can help you update your Shopify store to version 2.0 ‚Äì whether it&#8217;s upgrading your existing Theme to 2.0 OR starting with a fresh new 2.0 Theme. </strong></p>



<p>Either way, moving forward, your store will look better, load faster and be easier to update and manage!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Have you ever looked at your Shopify store and thought, <em>‚ÄúThis definitely could be better.‚Äù</em> </h2>



<p>We&#8217;d probably agree you üòâ</p>



<p><strong>The design of your store is a big part of how customers perceive your brand. </strong>High-quality, eye-catching websites are one of the first things potential customers see when they start to research various brands and products. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>In fact, a recent survey showed that 94% of website visitors say that a company‚Äôs website is important in influencing their buying decision. </em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>A strong first impression can make all the difference between someone simply reading about your brand or them immediately adding it to their shopping cart so they can add more of your merchandise to their cart later. </p>



<p>So what does that mean for you? <strong>Well, updating your store to Shopify 2.0 might be just what you need to take it from good to great!</strong> Let‚Äôs take a closer look at why‚Ä¶</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So what‚Äôs NEW in Shopify 2.0?</h2>



<p><strong>There‚Äôs a lot of new features and functionality! </strong></p>



<p>Keep in mind that these changes aren‚Äôt just cosmetic. They are designed to improve the overall online shopping experience for customers and give you more tools to help you attract new clients and increase your sales. Here‚Äôs a quick look at what you can expect from the new Shopify 2.0 design: </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Customisable home page</strong> ‚Äì add, rearrange, or remove sections to create your page layout.</li>



<li><strong><strong>Customisable Sections on ALL page</strong>s </strong>‚Äì (technically on &#8220;most&#8221; pages) ‚Äì&nbsp;you can now add, rearrange, or remove sections and blocks to create unique page layouts.</li>



<li><strong>Enhanced search engine optimisation</strong> ‚Äì every aspect of Shopify has been optimized for search engine ranking, making it easier for potential customers to find your products. </li>



<li><strong>Enhanced marketing tools for shops</strong> ‚Äì Shopify has added a few new features that let you easily promote your products across social media and your website, increasing your chances of more sales.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Sections are everywhere (YAY!)</h2>



<p>A section is what creates your page ‚Äì&nbsp;you&#8217;ll know of these if you&#8217;ve ever gone in to edit your home page. Whether it&#8217;s a banner, a featured product or collection or simply blocks of text; each of these sections in Shopify mean you can build your home page and move the Sections around without the need to code.</p>



<p>Up until the Shopify 2.0 launch, you could only use these Sections on your home page. Every other page would be a simple text post (like a blog) sitting within the same Page template ‚Äì <em>boringgggg</em>! OR you need to use a custom page builder, app or asked a developer to code it ‚Äì&nbsp;which is time consuming, requires a developer and a designer and therefore is quite costly.</p>



<p><strong>With Shopify 2.0, sections are EVERYWHERE! </strong></p>



<p>You can easily create new Page templates within the Theme Editor using the visual builder ‚Äì essentially removing the need for development time, and minimising designer time. </p>



<p>This all changes with the new Shopify 2.0 which means sections can now be used on <em>any page</em> across your entire site. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">It&#8217;s just a better customer experience</h2>



<p>Beyond just giving your store a fresh new look, Shopify 2.0 has been engineered from the ground up to create a better customer experience for your clients. </p>



<p>This includes things like enhanced search engine optimization that lets more people find your products, a new live chat feature where you can easily answer questions about your products, and an intuitive checkout process that ensures customers don‚Äôt experience any issues when completing their purchase. </p>



<p>If you‚Äôre worried that upgrading to Shopify 2.0 might cause problems for your clients, there‚Äôs no need to fret. Shopify has taken a lot of care to ensure that people who have been using Shopify 1.0 will be able to easily transition to the new platform. They‚Äôve also done their best to maintain the same level of security and privacy that existed in 1.0, so there is no reason to avoid the update.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The benefits of using Divi on a WordPress website</h2>



<p>Let&#8217;s quickly cover why we use Divi for so many of our clients&#8217; website first. Divi is a WordPress theme that offers a wide range of benefits, the main one being is its <strong>user-friendly drag-and-drop interface,</strong> which makes it easy for anyone in your marketing team to manage your content and website long-term. We prefer to empower our clients to own their website, rather than lock you into rigid maintenance agreements with us.</p>



<p><em>(But if you need, we&#8217;re here to help with managing your website once it&#8217;s built, or to help guide your team with editing content).</em></p>



<p>Divi also offers a <a href="https://www.elegantthemes.com/gallery/divi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vast library of pre-designed layouts and templates</a> that can be customised to fit your brand&#8217;s unique look and feel. This saves time and money, allowing you to focus on other important aspects of your business.</p>



<p><strong>However, we rarely work from templates as we prefer to provide a completely unique design for your brand and allows for easy management in the long-term.</strong></p>



<p>Another benefit of Divi is its responsive design, which ensures that your website looks great on all devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. Obviously important since you&#8217;re likely reading on your mobile, and Google ranks mobile-friendly websites higher in search results.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The benefits of choosing Sevah Creative to design and build your Divi website</h2>



<p>We&#8217;re small (but tenacious) team with <a href="https://sevahcreative.com/about/">Zoe</a> our founder and creative lead (an experienced designer &amp; marketing mind) and <a href="https://sevahcreative.com/about/">John</a> our co-founder (the business brain and motion graphic extraordinaire). We also have competent, skilled developer teams offshore that work with us closely to deliver a high-standard (we vet everything here); plus a wide network of social advertising experts, copywriters and content strategists, SEO experts, hosting providers and more that we love to refer our clients to. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>We may be small, but we&#8217;re smart! Our focus has always been to refer our clients to the best resources and ensure you get an excellent result ‚Äì&nbsp;rather than trying to money-grab and provide every service ourselves. </em></p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>Based on the Gold Coast Australia, we&#8217;re super passionate about creating beautiful AND functional websites.</strong> We understand the importance of a website that accurately reflects your brand&#8217;s personality and values, but also meets the specific functionality requirements of your business.</p>



<p>We include a thorough SEO migration from your existing website to your new website (so you don&#8217;t lose that precious SEO juice!) and ensure that your website is seen by the right audiences. This is especially important for Australian and Gold Coast businesses that want to attract local customers.</p>



<p>You can choose to have us involved in every aspect of your website, or just the design aspect. We work closely with you to understand your unique needs and create a bespoke website that delivers the results your business needs..</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why a custom design is vital</h2>



<p>While Divi offers a wide range of pre-designed layouts and templates, using these &#8220;cookie-cutter&#8221; templates can result in your website looking similar to many others, and not meeting the unique needs of your brand. By creating custom Divi website design (using a Child Theme), we ensure that your website accurately reflects your brand&#8217;s personality and values, and stands out from the crowd.</p>



<p>A custom Divi Child Theme offers a range of benefits, beyond just the ability to choose your own colors, fonts, and layouts. We can tailor your website specifically to your brand&#8217;s unique needs, with <a href="https://sevahcreative.com/design/">custom icon design</a> and graphics, website animation and motion graphics to bring it to life.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Sevah Creative provides a bespoke service</h2>



<p>We work closely with you to understand your unique requirements and offer a range of services to ensure that your website accurately reflects your brand&#8217;s personality.</p>



<p>Our bespoke service starts with a consultation, where we discuss your unique needs and requirements. We don&#8217;t blow out your timeline a multi stage production (unless you specifically want us to wireframe and design prior to development); instead, once copy and the site map is approved, we work directly in Divi to design and build at the same time.</p>



<p><strong>Typically we work with the homepage design first, and this helps to guide the remainder of the site design. All our projects include 1-2 rounds of revisions as agreed at the start, so we can make sure we get everything exactly right before launch.</strong></p>



<p>Whether you want us to handle everything from start to finish, or just be involved in the design aspect, we&#8217;re dedicated to creating a website that IS YOUR BRAND. You can trust that your website will not only look great, but also be functional, user-friendly, and tailored specifically to your brand&#8217;s unique needs.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re ready to take the first step in creating a custom Divi website design for your website, <a href="https://sevahcreative.com/contact/">get in touch with us today</a> (Zoe will reply back to you personally). </p>



<p>OR if you&#8217;re ready to go, just <a href="https://sevahcreative.com/website-brief/">complete our website brief form</a>, and we can get a quote back to you ASAP. </p>



<p>We&#8217;re excited to work with you every step of the way to ensure that your website is not only beautiful, but also functional.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Don&#8217;t settle for a cookie-cutter website that looks like everyone else&#8217;s. </strong></h2>

<p>Marketing jargon can confuse many people ‚Äì&nbsp;including the professionals! Certain terms are often used quite loosely and end up being jumbled together, sometimes leading us to think they are one and the same. However, when it comes to the design of logos and brands ‚Äì there is a clear distinction between them. </p>



<p>So we want to help you quickly understand the distinction between what a brand is, branding, a brand identity and logo design.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Is A Logo?</strong></h2>



<p>At its simplest, a logo can be defined as a visual, written text or a combination of both representing a brand, its name and what your business does. </p>



<p>Looking at what a brand is from a bigger picture, brand logo designs are a vital part of a business‚Äôs brand identity. This is because it is the one factor that identifies your brand and is recognisable to people. It is a vehicle that conveys your brand‚Äôs personality and value. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><strong>However, it is important to remember that a logo is not your brand.</strong></p></blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Is A Brand?</strong></h2>



<p>The overall image that businesses and professionals portray through a collection of perceptions, feelings, and ideas about their business to consumers, is a brand ‚Äì <strong>brands are a function of branding efforts. </strong></p>



<p>But remember that <em>your brand is built over time</em> through actions and practices that eventually become a norm from the perspective of consumers.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Is Branding?</strong></h2>



<p>How is it then that a brand becomes a brand from the company‚Äôs efforts? Branding! The actions taken by businesses to build the image that consumers consume and notice is essentially what branding is. These are the processes that affect how your business or company develops its identity. </p>



<p>These can be seen in the company‚Äôs logo and in the brand mark sent out to the world, the voice of the business, its tone and how it communicates with its consumers, among other things.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Is a Brand Identity?</strong></h2>



<p>Here, your business focuses on the identity being created through the branding process. How you want to be seen and every part of the branding right through to your logo. </p>



<p>Your brand identity aims to shine a light on your company‚Äôs unique purposes. These can be seen in your logo, business material, non-visual communication, messaging, marketing material, product packaging, and signage. Generally this is brought together in a Brand Guide or similar brand identity documentation ‚Äì&nbsp;that can be used for internal stakeholders (and limited external stakeholders). The main goal of a Brand Guide is to help everyone involved in the business, to continue to grow that brand over time.</p>



<p>It is important that you clearly define and understand the roles and purposes of each of the above mentioned. This will help you set clear goals and objectives for your business so that execution is seamless. Furthermore, this will help support your business activities and enable the brand logo design company you work with to work effectively.</p>



<p><strong>At Sevah Creative, we‚Äôre ready to take your business design, from logos to brand identity, to the next level.</strong> We are professionals at producing top-notch brand logo designs services and are ready to help you. </p>

<p>Need product photography in Australia? </p>



<p>It&#8217;s important that product photographer or agency that you hire make you feel confident about your investment ‚Äì so that your products are not only captured in their best light, but the overall impact to your bottom line is positive.</p>



<p>When searching for a professional product photographer in Australia, you need to look at a number of things, including their portfolio and testimonials from previous clients. And of course, make sure you look at their <a href="https://sevahcreative.com/work/product-photography/">past work</a> so you can see if you like their style and quality.</p>



<p>Capturing photos of your products is serious business!</p>



<p><strong>However, do you know some of the questions you need to ask your potential product photography service provider?</strong> Worry not, we‚Äôve got you covered!</p>



<p><em>Here are some of the most important questions to ask product photographers:</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Equipment Do You Use?</strong></h2>



<p>Your product photography is reliant on the best and most appropriate equipment to get the best captured and edited images. Each camera and lens used need to be of high quality, but it doesn‚Äôt end there. Your product photographer needs to also be equipped with the correct lighting, props and staging for the shoot.</p>



<p><em>Example ‚Äì&nbsp;at Sevah Creative, we use a Sony a7iii camera, a number of different lenses, a variety of studio lighting, gimbals, a drone, backdrops and a ever-growing prop collection! Our in house studio set-up is suitable for most small &#8211; medium products. We also have a kitchen on site, so are equipped to do food photography as well.</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What About Studio Product Photography?</strong></h2>



<p>Does your product photographer have studio product photography experience? The product photographer must have experience in different product categories because this will show that they have an understanding of lighting, props, positioning and highlighting the types of products you want to be taken.</p>



<p><em>Example ‚Äì&nbsp;at Sevah Creative, we do small to medium sized products (across a variety of industries), plus food photography.</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How Much Bang Will I Get For My Buck?</strong></h2>



<p>It is important to have an understanding of the number of images you‚Äôll be getting in the end. This will obviously vary from different photographers around Australia but it&#8217;s really just about the amount of work your photo shoot, planning and editing requires. </p>



<p>Different styles of shots will vary a lot in cost as well ‚Äì¬†taking a simple product shot vs an elaborate scene set-up will obviously be very different prices. Not to mention if we need to do intensive editing time on top.</p>



<p><em>Example ‚Äì at Sevah Creative, we custom quote each photoshoot so you&#8217;re getting the exact shots you need, without overspending your budget. We love if you are ready to invest, as it&#8217;s definitely more cost-effective to shoot in large batches (say 20+ photos)</em> <em>‚Äì every shoot takes set-up, planning, prop sourcing and more; so if we can do that once for a 2 day shoot, it will bring the overall cost down for you</em>. <em>If you are on a tight budget, we can start with as little as 10 photos.</em> <em>We will also quite often create more photos as creativity takes over, that you can purchase individually as you need.</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What‚Äôs Included And What Isn‚Äôt?</strong></h2>



<p>In most cases, professional product photography studios can provide a number of items included in their packages such as props, styling, photo editing, overtime for extended shoots, photography assistants, and travel expenses. If you require additional services, you may need to pay additional charges, so make sure that you are clear on this prior to hiring product photography services on the Gold Coast.</p>



<p><em>Example ‚Äì at Sevah Creative, we don&#8217;t charge any studio hire fees as we have that on site. We have range of props that we can use, but quite often we will source specific props for your shoot at an additional cost. We can also source custom backdrop colours at an additional cost. </em></p>

<p>A custom-built <a href="https://www.elegantthemes.com/affiliates/idevaffiliate.php?id=67803" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Divi WordPress child theme</a> is one of the best practices for your website. The great thing about using a &#8220;child theme&#8221; is that not only does it allow us to really customise your website design, build and functionality, but it also allows for ongoing updates and speeds up the development process.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re going to look at some of the benefits of having a professional, custom Divi WordPress theme developed by a web design company in Australia. We recommend and use one of the most versatile, yet easy-to-use CMS solutions for most of our website builds ‚Äì<em> WordPress with the Divi Theme and a custom Divi child theme.</em></p>



<p>But first‚Ä¶</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Is A Child Theme?</strong></h3>



<p>A child theme is essentially a sub theme that takes on the functionality, features and styling of the parent theme (in this case, the Divi theme). It provides a safe approach to modifying files, without actually editing the parent theme.</p>



<p>Child themes are made up of a series of files created via text or a code editor. WordPress will apply the parent theme files, unless there are files of the same name in the child theme ‚Äì&nbsp;in which case, the child theme will override the parent theme.</p>



<p>This allows for complete customisation of the theme, whilst maintaining the ability to easily update the themes (and not have to continually fix broken files).</p>



<p><em>To give you a simple example, a custom 404 error page is created using a child theme. When creating a custom 404 error page needs a child theme along with a 404.php file. WordPress will find a custom 404.php file in the child theme, and if no file is found to execute, it will use the default 404.php file in the Divi theme package.</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Benefits Of Custom Built Divi WordPress Child Theme</strong></h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Site Customisations</strong></h3>



<p>The above example indicates how using Divi child themes in development is a great way of making valuable enhancements to a WordPress site. As a professional web design company in Australia, we&#8217;re able to add aesthetic improvements and other functional enhancement to your custom-built Divi WordPress child theme. We can add:</p>



<ul><li>Customised 404 error pages</li><li>Unique headers and footers</li><li>Bespoke post &amp; archive layouts for blog</li><li>Custom search pages</li><li>Custom post types e.g. Events, Case Studies, News / Media</li><li>Anything that can be done with CSS or .php edits ‚Äì which is a lot!</li></ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ironclad Protection</strong></h3>



<p>Divi child themes are also instrumental as they protect your website development work from future updates. Every theme will be updated at some point, and if you didn&#8217;t create a child theme, all your customisation can be overridden with the update. With a child theme in place, when the parent theme is updated, your child theme retains all the customisations.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Divi Child Themes Are Simple to Manage</strong></h3>



<p>One of the other benefits of having a web design company in Australia develop your custom Divi WordPress child theme is that once we hand you over your shiny new website, you can make basic edits yourself.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Every business owner or marketing manager has business goals that they need to achieve. This can range from collecting qualified leads, driving sales, or promoting a lead gen offer. </h3>



<p>A landing page is one thing that overtakes your websites‚Äô ability to hone in on a dedicated conversion objective (and generally a single conversion objective).</p>



<p>Having a website is essential of course as it has its own functions. However, when you‚Äôre trying get a visitor to do a specific action, your website will be distracting with its plethora of products, services, offers, pages, links, buttons etc&#8230;</p>



<p><strong>Which highlights what the main difference between a website and landing page is</strong>. A website will have multiple actions that a visitor can take, whereas a landing page narrows everything to focus solely on that one single action you want the visitor to take, which increases the chances of conversion.</p>



<p>Our preferred landing page app is <a href="https://unbounce.grsm.io/ZoeTattersall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unbounce</a>, and we‚Äôve worked with the platform since 2013. As an experienced Unbounce landing page designer, we have the quick-fire tactics to get the high-converting landing page design for your business needs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Are the Best Ways To Ensure Your Landing Page is a Hit?</strong></h2>



<p>Five core elements of an Unbounce landing page designer uses for a high-converting page:</p>



<ul><li>Knowing your unique selling proposition (USP)</li><li>A compelling hero shot</li><li>Enticing benefits (not just features!)</li><li>Real life social proof</li><li>Bang on call to action (CTA)</li></ul>



<p>This sounds simple enough, right? Putting it all into action is not always that simple though, which is why you need an Unbounce landing page designer to get the job done right.</p>



<p><em>Remember: your landing page only requires a single conversion goal ‚Äì that ONE THING you want to the visitors to do&nbsp;‚Äì click-through, form submission, sales.</em></p>



<p>In this post, we&#8217;re going to touch on the five key elements that your landing page designer needs to get your conversion goals through the roof.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="640" src="https://sevahcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-12.11.19-pm-2-1024x640.png" alt="" class="wp-image-36342" srcset="https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-12.11.19-pm-2.png?size=216x135&amp;lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 216w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-12.11.19-pm-2-480x300.png?lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 480w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-12.11.19-pm-2.png?size=648x405&amp;lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 648w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-12.11.19-pm-2.png?size=864x540&amp;lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 864w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-12.11.19-pm-2-980x612.png?lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 980w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-12.11.19-pm-2-1024x640.png?lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" /><figcaption>Put that key USP right up the top, above the fold e.g.&nbsp;&#8216;just 48 hours with this proven plan&#8217;</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>#1. Your Unique Selling Proposition</strong></h2>



<p>Marketers love talking about USP, and for a good reason. Being able to highlight those things that set you apart from the rest is crucial for a landing page. Why should people consider your product or service and choose to convert ‚Ä¶ instead of clicking the back or close button (eek!).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="877" height="270" src="https://sevahcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-12.08.08-pm.png" alt="" class="wp-image-36338" srcset="https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-12.08.08-pm.png?size=216x66&amp;lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 216w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-12.08.08-pm-480x148.png?lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 480w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-12.08.08-pm.png?size=648x199&amp;lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 648w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-12.08.08-pm.png?lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 877w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 877px, 100vw" /><figcaption>Highlighting USPs by using social proof. </figcaption></figure>



<p>Every USP differentiates you and sets clear expectations to audiences and your customers. This helps to ensure the landing page supports your company&#8217;s objectives and helps to give people a glimpse into why your brand is the perfect fit for them.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s all about the one-of-a-kind experience that you&#8217;re offering.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>#2: The Hero Shot!</strong></h2>



<p>Next, your Unbounce landing page designer will need that one image that tells a thousand words. We live in a fast-paced world where our attention wavers in and out all the time, so you&#8217;re going to need a visual representation that evokes a desire to want to know more, or better yet, says it all.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="953" height="582" src="https://sevahcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-12.12.41-pm.png" alt="" class="wp-image-36344" srcset="https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-12.12.41-pm.png?size=216x132&amp;lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 216w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-12.12.41-pm-480x293.png?lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 480w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-12.12.41-pm.png?size=648x396&amp;lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 648w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-12.12.41-pm.png?size=864x528&amp;lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 864w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-12.12.41-pm.png?lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 953w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 953px, 100vw" /><figcaption>Even a faded out background image can add more context to your landing page.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Or maybe that‚Äôs a video background ‚Äì but make sure you‚Äôre only adding a video background if it actually adds value and information to the page. Not just for the sake of it (don‚Äôt load up your page speed unnecessarily).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="998" height="648" src="https://sevahcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-12.16.00-pm.png" alt="" class="wp-image-36343" srcset="https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-12.16.00-pm.png?size=216x140&amp;lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 216w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-12.16.00-pm-480x312.png?lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 480w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-12.16.00-pm.png?size=648x421&amp;lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 648w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-12.16.00-pm.png?size=864x561&amp;lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 864w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-12.16.00-pm-980x636.png?lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 980w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-12.16.00-pm.png?lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 998w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 998px, 100vw" /><figcaption>Add emotion to your page with an image those shows exactly what you&#8217;re offering.</figcaption></figure>



<p>You want that image to make the visitors that hit your landing page imagine a scenario they see themselves using your product. The best way to achieve this is through the visuals and landing page copy. These two need to tell the story and resonate with your audience.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>#3: Got Some Features and Benefits?</strong></h2>



<p>Another key element that your landing page designer will focus on is the features section, where we&#8217;re now diving into providing details and answering any questions. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="537" src="https://sevahcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-12.16.15-pm-1024x537.png" alt="" class="wp-image-36345" srcset="https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-12.16.15-pm.png?size=216x113&amp;lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 216w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-12.16.15-pm-480x252.png?lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 480w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-12.16.15-pm.png?size=648x340&amp;lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 648w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-12.16.15-pm.png?size=864x453&amp;lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 864w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-12.16.15-pm-980x514.png?lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 980w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-12.16.15-pm-1024x537.png?lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" /><figcaption>Adding graphics or icons to each feature / benefit helps those that don&#8217;t read every word on your page (which is everyone!)</figcaption></figure>



<p>What you don‚Äôt want to forget to do is talk about the feature in terms of how they benefit the user ‚Äì&nbsp;try not to just list a bunch of features and expect visitors to make the connection themselves. </p>



<p><em>Here‚Äôs an example:</em></p>



<ul><li>Feature driven ‚Äì<strong> Unbounce allows you to create a customisable landing page that focuses on one conversion goal.</strong></li><li>Benefit driven ‚Äì <strong>Unbounce allows you to <em>convert more visitors</em> through landing pages and <em>increase your ROI.</em></strong></li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>#4: Where&#8217;s the Social Proof</strong></h2>



<p>Show people they can trust you. Or think of it like a bit of friendly ‚Äòpeer pressure‚Äô!</p>

<p>A powerful tool of persuasion lies in the social signals that prove others have who&#8217;ve bought your products, used your services and immersed themselves in your offerings. So, make sure your landing page highlights this.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="300" src="https://sevahcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-12.15.01-pm-1024x300.png" alt="" class="wp-image-36349" srcset="https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-12.15.01-pm.png?size=216x63&amp;lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 216w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-12.15.01-pm-480x141.png?lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 480w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-12.15.01-pm.png?size=648x190&amp;lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 648w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-12.15.01-pm.png?size=864x253&amp;lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 864w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-12.15.01-pm-980x287.png?lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 980w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-12.15.01-pm-1024x300.png?lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" /><figcaption>It doesn&#8217;t have to be just testimonials ‚Äì trust factor can be built by association too.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Be in control of the narrative and show off those wonderful customer reviews, testimonials, accreditations, awards, partnerships etc.</p>



<p>Don‚Äôt make them up though and don‚Äôt use stock photos for the people, please!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>#5: A Bang on Call To Action</strong></h2>



<p>The entire purpose of a landing page is to get those conversions, right? What&#8217;s the ultimate way to get them? Your call to action (CTA)! This is the part that tells the audience what to do.</p>

<p>Try to get a bit more creative than just &#8220;click here&#8221; or &#8220;submit&#8221; ‚Äì make the CTA say exactly what will happen when the user takes action ‚Äì&nbsp;‚ÄúDownload PDF‚Äù or ‚ÄúLearn More‚Äù or ‚ÄúUpgrade Today‚Äù.</p>



<p>Go bold with your CTA as long and try quirkier ideas ‚Äì as long it delivers the action you require from your audience.</p>





<p>It&#8217;s is vital that you have a professional Unbounce landing page designer on board to help you with your conversion goals. And if you‚Äôre running paid traffic to your website, think again! It‚Äôs even MORE important that you have a landing page for that.</p>

<p>Imagery! Photos are the first thing that pops out and grabs your attention when you land on an e-commerce site, right? And for a good reason! Did you know that our brains process images 60, 000 times faster than text?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As an eCommerce website owner, it is important that you‚Äôre aware of this as visitors to your website are forming their first impression based on what they see. We often buy products from brands we trust and our impression of what we see counts on our purchase decisions.</p>



<p>Because of this, quality <a href="https://sevahcreative.com/work/product-photography/">product photography </a>is crucial. The better the product photography is, the more likely your offerings will be perceived as high-value products.</p>



<p>There are several product photography services on the Gold Coast, and our experts have put this post together to highlight the different product photography types for your e-commerce website.</p>

<p>A commercial product photography style is very on trend currently ‚Äì&nbsp;but it&#8217;s also timeless. With the continued growth of social media and visual content in general, having a wide variety of shots is essential to keep your social accounts fresh, test what is best received by your audience and showcase your product&#8217;s benefits.</p>



<p>A studio shot may be anything from a simple product set-up to an elaborate, custom built set. Both are useful, and depending on your brand aesthetic, you may only stick to one style.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to consider the story you want to share with your audience, and that&#8217;s where we come in! We love to take your product and use photography to illustrate it&#8217;s benefits (let&#8217;s face it, bullet points just don&#8217;t cut it now, you have to make your audience FEEL something!).</p>



<p>Some important things that we consider to help you decide on what shots you need ‚Äì</p>



<ul><li>Where is the shot going to be used i.e. what size e.g. for social 1:1, 4:5 or 9:16</li><li>Will there be graphics or text added to it? We&#8217;ll make sure there is enough &#8216;white space&#8217; around the image to do so!</li><li>Are there specific brand colours you need used? We&#8217;ll get PMS matched coloured backdrops made.</li><li>We&#8217;ll source the perfect props will tell your product story OR pick from our (always growing) in-house collection.</li><li>Do we need to build custom sets?</li></ul>



<p>There&#8217;s lots to consider when planning a studio shoot, so make sure you book us at least a few weeks in advanced for when you need the photos delivered.</p>

<p>If you want to show your customers what their life could and look like when using your products, lifestyle shots are a must! In these shots, products are generally taken in their natural environment, like places you‚Äôd expect to see or use them OR being used by people that your target audience will relate to or aspire to.</p>



<p>Using this type of<a href="https://sevahcreative.com/work/product-photography/"> product photography</a> helps customers visualise using the product, whether at home or in their lives. Lifestyle shots also aim to create a relationship and connect with your audiences, so make sure you consider lifestyle photography for your brand and product.</p>



<p>These are also often used on e-commerce websites as well as in social media posts.</p>

<p>What you see is what you get, and that&#8217;s what people what confidence in when they are making an online purchase.</p>



<p>Simple product photos, often on a white or single colour background, are meant to present the product as clearly and attractively as possible. These shots are all about clarity, and also being able to highlight details. We may even get right up close and personal to zone in on features of parts of a product.</p>



<p>Product shots are mostly placed in product pages, often as &#8220;deep-etched&#8221; image ‚Äì&nbsp;which refers to the process of removing the product from its background so that it can be either a transparent PNG file OR a different colour background can be added (generally white, but could be any of your brand colours).</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://sevahcreative.com/design/">Brand logo design services </a>or a &#8220;brand identity&#8221; is a way to make a memorable impression and allow your audience to connect with your product or service.</h3>



<p>So you‚Äôre starting a business, or perhaps you‚Äôve got a couple of years under your belt. Everything seems to be moving smoothly, but somehow there‚Äôs a gap; you‚Äôre not getting the conversion you‚Äôre working so hard for. The problem? Your branding might be missing the mark.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/EhvVoeXC1PIIM/giphy.gif" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p>There&#8217;s many elements to a brand identity and <em>really good</em> branding can help distinguish your business from your competitors, clarify your offerings and set you apart. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>Branding can make or break your business.</p></blockquote>



<p><strong>But it‚Äôs not just about the logo design.</strong> There is much more included and involved in creating a solid brand identity ‚Äì&nbsp;it&#8217;s everything from the logo to the colour palette, font choices, illustrative style, photography aesthetic ‚Äì even the tone of voice, company vision and mission is part of your brand. </p>



<p>Before diving into a new brand identity, it‚Äôs important to remember the design details, such as the brand colour palette, fonts, and all the design do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What‚Äôs Included In A Brand Logo Design?</strong></h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Memorable Encounters</h3>



<p>What comes first &#8211; the brand or the logo? Is there a difference?</p>



<p>Yes, there is definitely a difference! The thing with the first question is that much like everything in digital marketing; things are constantly being redefined and adjusted. With this being said, your brand should be in the frontline, followed by a logo that matches and enhances this brand identity. Neither should be created in a silo, but as a part of an overall strategy.</p>



<p>The logo is often what pieces the puzzle together. Logos have a way of sparking nostalgia, shared experiences, and tap into our emotions.</p>



<p>In fact, often when we do logo design, we create sub marks for different application e.g. your primary logo may be quite complicated, so a simpler version is necessary for small spaces. </p>



<p>But, as I mentioned, branding services aren‚Äôt all about the logo, there‚Äôs more.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://sevahcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/How-to-Empower-Yourself-with-Color-Psychology-Varying-Colors.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-36180" width="796" height="430" srcset="https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/How-to-Empower-Yourself-with-Color-Psychology-Varying-Colors.jpg?size=216x117&amp;lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 216w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/How-to-Empower-Yourself-with-Color-Psychology-Varying-Colors-480x259.jpg?lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 480w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/How-to-Empower-Yourself-with-Color-Psychology-Varying-Colors.jpg?size=648x350&amp;lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 648w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/How-to-Empower-Yourself-with-Color-Psychology-Varying-Colors.jpg?lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 796w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 796px, 100vw" /><figcaption>via <a href="https://londonimageinstitute.com/how-to-empower-yourself-with-color-psychology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">London Image Institute</a></figcaption></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Appealing Colour Palette</h3>



<p>Closely following the logo design is the colour palette, which can be any number of colours and sub-palettes. Understanding how colours trigger emotions and interact with each other is essential for representing your brand strategy in the right way.</p>



<p>Colour is very subjective of course ‚Äì with personal, situational and even cultural factors coming into play.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.printed.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-20-at-11.57.04.png" alt="Understanding the psychology¬†of typography is a powerful tool in any graphic designer‚Äôs arsenal. If you‚Äôre a designer or creative then you‚Äôve probably spent hours sifting through different typography styles, in order to find that perfect one for a customer or client. But how do you know which font to pick when designing for a brand, business, piece of promotional material or, well, just about anything? A simple font change can drastically affect a piece of artwork or document, but what is it about typography that can change a perception so quickly? We‚Äôre going to take a look at the psychology of typography, its importance, and how knowing your stuff can make all the difference when it comes to design ‚Äì so settle in, grab a cuppa, and get ready to take a wordy-journey through serifs, letterpress, branding and perception."/><figcaption>via <a href="https://www.printed.com/blog/psychology-of-typography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Printed</a></figcaption></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Maximise On The Typography</h3>



<p>The font you use is not something to take lightly. The type of font you receive from brand logo design services needs to complement both the logo and colours for perfect harmony.</p>



<p>Remember, there is power in the fonts you choose. In many cases, your brand logo font is instantly recognisable, even in a different context, and that‚Äôs the power of typography.</p>



<p>Your logo font is often different from fonts you use for everyday applications ‚Äì&nbsp;and you will likely need different fonts for web, print and email ‚Äì&nbsp;there&#8217;s more to it than just aesthetics!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">On-brand Supporting Graphics &amp; Photography</h3>



<p>The world has never been brighter or so multidimensional.

<p>Product photography is an essential marketing service that can make or break your website. It is important to remember that photography has the power to increase conversions. <a href="https://sevahcreative.com/content/">Visual elements</a> are a key element in decision-making because your product photography quality reflects your brand image, which creates the first impression.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Product photos are essential, but why, and how important are they? Over <strong>75% of e-Commerce shoppers respond to product photos and say that their quality influences their buyer‚Äôs journey when purchasing online</strong> (<a href="https://www.weebly.com/inspiration/online-store-product-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">source</a>).</p>



<p>Stats also indicate that <strong>22% of online shoppers return products because items often look far different than posted images</strong> (<a href="https://www.weebly.com/guides/product-photography-guide/how-important-is-product-photography" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">source</a>). Eek. </p>



<p>You must represent your products <span style="text-decoration: underline;">as accurately as possible</span> for your audience ‚Äì this can save you money in the bank and that valuable commodity, time.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What‚Äôs Involved In Product Photography Services?</strong></h2>



<p>It is vital to remember that there‚Äôs a lot that goes into a product photography shoot. And these elements can affect pricing. The photography and design agency sets a budget based on the client‚Äôs requirements, so custom pricing agencies are often ideal.</p>



<p><strong>A photoshoot may just seem like a simple thing, but a lot of work goes into it!</strong></p>



<p>From reviewing your brand to ensure we capture the right tone and style, to pre-production planning of each shot, sourcing props to building custom sets. Then of course there is the actual shoot time, which includes setting up the sets &amp; studio space, adjusting lighting, styling the shots, checking each photo ‚Äì&nbsp;sometimes a single photo can take hours!</p>



<p>After the shoot, we hit the post-production ‚Äì&nbsp;sifting through hundreds (sometimes thousands!) of photos to choose the best ones, then going through edits in both Lightroom and often Photoshop too. Again, a single photo could take hours of editing.</p>



<p>This is why we don&#8217;t offer &#8216;package prices&#8217; for our <a href="https://sevahcreative.com/product-photography" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">product photograph</a>y. Every single shoot is custom priced so you get exactly what you pay for and we can help you decide what is absolutely necessary if you&#8217;re working towards a budget. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><strong>Tip</strong>: It&#8217;s most cost effective to batch shoot! That is, it will generally be less expensive to shoot 20 photos as on project, compared to two separate shoots of 10 photos each. Most clients will opt for quarterly shoots over the year which allows for plenty of planning time. </p></blockquote>



<p>Professional photography agencies understand that being unique is what makes them stand out. Not only this, but they can offer a service like no other for the benefit of their clients‚Äô end-goal. With custom quoted services, you‚Äôre not only getting your money‚Äôs worth, but you are assured of quality solutions, especially when you require high-end commercial product photography service.</p>



<p>In today‚Äôs faced-paced marketing world, grabbing the attention of audiences and web users through your website, marketing material, and across various social media platforms, bright colours, prints, and lifestyle settings play a vital role in helping display your products appealingly and creatively. However, you still need to tell the story of the product. Through well-captured product photography services, you can tap into the audience‚Äôs <em>emotions</em>, which is essential in the buyer‚Äôs journey.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>We all know the power of social media, but did you know that <strong>visual content gets up to 40 times more shares across social media platforms?</strong> </p></blockquote>



<p>The quality of your product photography is vital if you want your offerings to go viral. Consider emotional and visual cues and how you can persuade purchase decisions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/95/5a/be/955abef7d783c7854ba729c68387c891.gif" alt="The 30 Best Quotes From &quot;Clueless&quot; | Clueless quotes, Clueless movie, Cher  clueless" width="796" height="439"/></figure>



<p><strong>And in conclusion</strong>&#8230;</p>

<p>There are plenty of tried-and-tested methods of finding a web designer on the Gold Coast who can meet your needs. If you haven&#8217;t successfully got the right person for the job, these five key points should help.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re going to look at the characteristics you need to look out for when choosing a <a href="https://sevahcreative.com/design/">web design company</a> and web designer to help you make an informed decision.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>#1: Experience In Your Industry</strong></h2>



<p>Your starting point should always be eliminating web designers that have no experience in your field. Experience counts, but even more so if it&#8217;s in your industry. This is also important if you want to avoid tedious design processes, lengthy planning, and back and forth editing. So be sure to find a Gold Coast web designer who&#8217;s worked in your industry.</p>



<p>That said, if the website designer you‚Äôre looking at doesn‚Äôt have experience in your industry, but you really like their design aesthetic and other elements of their work ‚Äì then sometimes rules are made to be broken!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="853" src="https://sevahcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/BPD-website-1-1-1024x853.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-35269" srcset="https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/BPD-website-1-1.jpg?size=216x180&amp;lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 216w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/BPD-website-1-1-480x400.jpg?lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 480w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/BPD-website-1-1.jpg?size=648x540&amp;lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 648w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/BPD-website-1-1.jpg?size=864x720&amp;lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 864w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/BPD-website-1-1-980x817.jpg?lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 980w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" /><figcaption><a href="https://sevahcreative.com/project/bpdzenith/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://sevahcreative.com/project/bpdzenith/</a></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>#2: Appropriate Pricing</strong></h2>



<p>Next to experience, the price tag is the next vital aspect to consider. The price of hiring a web designer on the Gold Coast, Australia, will vary wildly depending on your needs and the extent of work required on your website.</p>



<p>When we say ‚Äúappropriate‚Äù ‚Äì&nbsp;we don‚Äôt just mean find the cheapest! Many of our clients come to us needing a website re-design after they went the cheap route with their initial website build. Cutting costs on your website design will very likely only create more expenses in the long-term.</p>



<p>Make sure that you set a substantial budget before going on the hunt for a web designer. Remember that web design and development‚Äôs main aim is to solve a problem. Quality web designers rely not only on their skills and expertise but on data. So, from research to factoring in your personal, unique requirements, mandatory user-experience, functionality, and robust development are essential. The age old saying that ‚Äúyou get what you pay for‚Äù definitely rings true when it comes to website design.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>#3: Knowledge, Methods &amp; Strategies</strong></h2>



<p>When narrowing down potential web designers, make sure that you find out their level of knowledge, methodology, and strategy when creating websites. Additionally, to get a grasp of their capabilities and insights that could be helpful to you, here‚Äôs some questions to consider asking:</p>



<ul><li>What is your design process? </li><li>What CMS (content management system) do they use? <em>(Is it easy to use?)</em></li><li>How will the website help to drive traffic and generate leads?</li><li>Do you follow SEO best practices when building the site?</li><li>What types of conversion strategies do you suggest?</li><li>What kind of testing do you perform prior to the launch of a new website?</li><li>Will we be able to make basic edits to the website once the site is live? <em>(This goes back the choice of CMS ‚Äì we use Divi, which is very simple to learn).</em></li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://sevahcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/StreamlineVerify-website-1-1024x853.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-35760" width="821" height="683" srcset="https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/StreamlineVerify-website-1.jpg?size=216x180&amp;lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 216w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/StreamlineVerify-website-1-480x400.jpg?lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 480w, https://b2059080.smushcdn.com/2059080/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/StreamlineVerify-website-1.jpg?size=648x539&amp;lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 648w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 821px, 100vw" /><figcaption><a href="https://sevahcreative.com/project/streamlineverify/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://sevahcreative.com/project/streamlineverify/</a></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>#4: Custom Designs</strong></h2>



<p>Make sure you ask your web designer if they are building your website design from scratch OR using a template. At Sevah, we custom design and build your website so that it‚Äôs not only 100% unique to your brand, but also so it‚Äôs actually FOR your brand ‚Äì that is, we don‚Äôt try to squish your brand and content into a stock standard template.</p>



<p>Whilst a template website may save some dollars, it won‚Äôt save you headaches down the track or give you the best conversion optimised website possible.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>#5: Long-Term Relationship</strong>s</h2>



<p>Finding the right web designer for your business can be tricky ‚Äì&nbsp;but once you‚Äôve worked with expert web designers, you&#8217;re going to want to stick with them. Make sure they are available for an ongoing relationship. It‚Äôs much easier to work long-term with one agency or designer, then having to constantly onboard new people.</p>
